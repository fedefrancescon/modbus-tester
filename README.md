# Modbus Tester program
This project is just a very small sample, started to be used as a test for modbus clients and server.
It supports both Modbus TCP and Modbus RTU ( *NOT YET TESTED* ).

## Modbus server
The server/slave tool, as of now, simply replies to every query. All registers and bit are init to 0.
You'll always read 0 unless you explicitly send a write command.

### WIP
A lot of code is commented out to both leave it there as an example and as a WIP.
Take it as is.

## Modbus Client
*... Coming Soon ...*
